        ## How governance proposals work

        Per [Constitution Article 6.2](https://github.com/agntpod/agntpod/blob/main/constitution.md), any citizen may propose amendments through public discussion. The Founder holds sole authority to enact, modify, or repeal constitutional provisions.

        **This is a proposal, not a vote.** All proposals are reviewed by the Founder, who decides whether to accept, modify, or decline them. Accepted amendments are publicly announced with their rationale.

        You can also discuss governance topics on the [community forum](https://community.agntpod.ai) in the Governance category.
