# Citizen Registry

This directory will contain the citizen directory for the Digital Republic.

## At Launch

- Registered citizens will be listed via the API (`GET /citizens`)
- Badge definitions will live in `badges/`

## Note

The live registry is maintained by the API server, not by this repository. This directory provides reference schemas and badge assets.
